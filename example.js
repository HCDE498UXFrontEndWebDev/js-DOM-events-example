// This example will show you some of the ways you can manipulate the HTML a user sees using javascript

// To start, let's make a variable that references the "body" element in the HTML so we can start adding to it

// Now, lets add something to it. Let's start with something simple, like a paragraph that says "My first new addition!"

// Okay, lets add something a bit more exciting, a boundless square!

// Start by making a "div" element and adding the a specific CSS rule to the div's classList

// Now, lets add a quote to the center of the square

// Now, lets add something special to make this quote truly boundless: rainbow coloring! We can make an event listener to be able to turn this on and off, depending on if it has been clicked.

// Though this square is pretty boundless already, lets make it literally boundless using some Javascript from W3 schools (which a great reference for common web coding problems like this, you should check them out: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_draggable.asp)
